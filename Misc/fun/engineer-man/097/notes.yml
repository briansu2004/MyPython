tips:
    use indexes:
        - index on commonly queried fields
        - good tradeoff for speed
    normalize your data and use joins:
        - store data separate from one another
        - reference that data with foreign keys
    use innodb:
        - myisam going away
        - innodb all around better
    enforce data integrity at the db level:
        - unique constraints
        - cascade deletes
    log queries in development:
        - great to see queries happening in real time
        - disable in production
    use consistent naming:
        - use short, easy to type field names
        - whichever naming format you choose, do it everywhere
    use transactions for bulk insert:
        - each insert triggers a reindex, this gets by that
        - no visibility of new data mid insert
