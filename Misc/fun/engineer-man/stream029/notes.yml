    - fan project review (projectreview@engineerman.org)

why:
    - create new interfaces
    - create new integrations
    - curiosity
    - security auditing
methods (in order of difficulty):
    web app:
        - super easy
        - watching chrome dev tools often enough
        - everything happening in plain sight
        - common with ip cameras
    mobile app (mitm):
        - sometimes super easy
        - mature software available, mitmproxy
        - on unrooted phones, pi in the middle might be necessary
        - involves hijacking https traffic in transit
        - can be thwarted by cert pinning and/or peer verification
    mobile app (mitm, pinned certs):
        - sometimes super easy
        - use objection to disable cert pinning
        - try previous again
    mobile app (above doesn't work):
        - hard
        - frida inspection & instrumentation
        - hook into various parts of the app to read output
        - much easier with a rooted phone
        - without root, only patched apk is possible
    examine firmware (freely available):
        - varying degree of difficulty
        - obfuscated/encrypted firmware adds new challenges
    examine firmware (get from device itself):
        - usually hard, sometimes impossible
        - must first break device out of case, usually ruining it
        - if successful, must locate uart pads
        - break out the solder gun
