Difference between bash/zsh/fish/other shells? Does the difference
really matter? (Shreyas, Kalix, Bydon)
    - running programs remains the same
    - difference in scripting and shell built-ins
    - does it really matter? to me? no. to some? definitely

I have written some effective bash scripts performing different tasks.
I was considering changing everything over to python based on the
current environment and hype over python.  Should we simply leave our
bash scripts in, well, bash or is there a good reason to convert over
to python? (Unknown)
    - "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"
    - let the requirements and business need drive the possibility
      of refactoring

What are daemons? What are they used for? (Jonathan Li)
    - another word for a background process
    - they are designed to run as a background process not attached
      to any terminal
    - usually has a `d` suffix

Why does the Linux Command Line feel so much better and/or easier to
use than either Command Prompt or Powershell? (SuperChump123)
    - linux/unix were designed with the terminal as a first-class tool
    - many programs are only available on the command Line
    - decades of development into command line shells
    - windows was designed gui first and command prompt is just there
    - powershell was an afterthought
    - powershell is the development effort command prompt should have been

Can you show practical examples of Named Pipes and/or when you might
use custom FD's. Thanks (Kevin C., Shreyas)
    - personally i've never used them in production (either one)
    - one use that comes to mind immeidately is allowing two programs to
      communicate with one another without the use of tcp or flat files

How come in windows there is lots of fail safes to stop people from
completely destroying their installation but in Linux you can just use the
command line and do a simple rm -rf command and destroy your
installation. (Akanate458)
    - safeguard 1 -- requires sudo to get rid of most important stuff
    - safeguard 2 -- rm -rf / is not enough, needs --no-preserve-root option
    - rmdir c:\ /s equally as destructive

Is there any way of obfuscating passwords passed as parameters to
commands? (Unknown)
    - even if passwords could be obfuscated, the program would need to
      understand the obfuscated password and thus the obfuscated password
      is now basically the password
    - most programs don't mandate the password being in the command itself

How has cloud changed command line monitoring of systems (w.s.)
    - question condensed
    - people pay for resources in the cloud
    - resources are dedicated
    - resources may not be what you think they are (physical attach vs nas)

do we still need linux if we have osx? (Unknown)
    - short answer -- yes
    - osx has strong ties to unix
    - linux has strong influence from unix
    - from a common user perspective, much of the same things can be
      accomplished on osx as linux
    - one big difference remains -- apple software is very much closed
    - linux is an open platform

What is snap and how it works? (saki)
    - snaps are almost like docker for linux programs

Best unix chad tips and tricks? (saki)
    - good working knowledge of your chosen shell and scripting

When to know it's appropriate to automate certain action? (saki)
    - automate when the development time is shorter than manual action
    - automate when you don't want to forget to do something

I'm really struggling with understanding grub configurations and efi. I have
a few different drives on my frankenstein-esque setup and I'd like to be able
to set up grub to give me the option to pick which drive I want at boot(sda,
sdb, sdc, etc..). I'm just not sure there is a way to do so. My current mode
of operation is to jam F8 to select a boot device. Not really elegant or
ideal. (Victor)
    - grub is a bootloader for partitions on a drive
    - because grub sits on a drive, it would follow that you must first select
      a drive

Reverse and dynamic tunnels are pretty confusing to me no matter how many
times I've tried to understand how it works... (Victor)
    - ssh -L -- binds a local port to a remote ip:port combo
    - ssh -R -- binds a remote port to a local ip:port combo

When will you change over to legendary VIM instead of nano? (Totally Not Kev)
    - vim must improve my productivity to be a viable option
    - no mouse is a problem
    - no preference on editor in the cloud

What is the advantages of using the command line over a GUI interface to
navigate files? (Kalix)
    - navigating might be slower via cli
    - searching, processing, etc. way faster via cli

Why was the command line invented? (Kalix)
    - historical roots
    - one of the first visual interactive computers was interactive
      via a terminal

Currently using Ubuntu What would be the next recommended flavour of Linux
you would recommend. (Francis)
    - arch linux or linux mint

I keep reading how Linux is compatible with older machines. Considering
purchasing a new dell machine besides Ubuntu what other flavours would be
compatible. (Francis)
    - architecture wise, linux is supported pretty much universally
    - driver wise, compatibility can be spotty but is still really good

I’m a developer but used windows for work. What Linux flavour would you
recommend for web and API development (Francis)
    - my preference for distros when i want to get work done is those
      which let me get running fast
    - xubuntu is my goto distro for this

You log into your cloud hosted server.... Something's up. The hairs on
the back of your neck stand up. Your dog let's out a low confused whimper
and lifts his head slowly up, looking at you with those eyes - he senses it.
You sense it. There's a 👻 in the shell... Now what?
Spend a few minutes talking about what commands you would run if you were
suspicious the Linux machine you'd just logged into was somehow compromised.
Explain your reasoning, where you'd start, why, and  to what end would
ultimately make you trust your machine again. (👻🐕‍🦺⚠️👻🚨👻😳😰👨‍💻🤔👨‍💻🤨🙅‍♂️👨‍💻😌)
    - run `w` to see if anybody is still logged in
    - run `last` to see log in history
    - run `history` to see command history
    - review the auth/ssh log and look for any accepted sessions
    - install rkhunter to check for rootkits
    - check for new users or groups
    - check authorized_keys file for new public keys
