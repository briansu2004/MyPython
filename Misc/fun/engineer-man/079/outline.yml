        - accessibility of new software

        - are there release schedules
        - do they adhere to release schedules
        - community size

distros:
    kubuntu:
        install: 10/10
            - good: easy to use gui
            - good: quick install
        software: 9/10
            - good: contains right amount of software, no real bloat
            - good: huge amounts of software available via apt
            - good: downstream of debian, so fully supports .deb packages

        community: 9/10
            - good: very large community with very active askubuntu stack site
            - good: reliable six month release schedule
            - good: reliable biennial long term support release cycle
            - bad: canonical, the steward of ubuntu gnome, sometimes
                   meddles in kubuntu business
    elementary-os:

            - good: easy to use gui
            - good: quick install

            - bad: contains no modern browser by default
            - bad: has pay-what-you-want appcenter. since linux is free and the
                   os is free, paid software gives windows/mac vibes and is
                   fairly counter to the objectives of foss

        software: 10/10
            - good: contains right amount of software, no real bloat
            - good: contains ms office online, windows converts will be happy
            - good: since manjaro is downstream of arch, manjaro has access to
                    a large amount of software from official arch channels as well
                    as the aur
        community: 9/10

                    reinstall a system
            - good: plenty of community resources
            - neutral: because of rolling releases, release dates are not concrete

            - neutral: there is no install option on boot. it goes to livecd
                       then an installer in launched optionally. unlike manjaro
                       it's pretty obvious to pick live/install after boot

            - neutral: contains very little software by default

            - good: is one of the oldest distros and therefore has countless resources
            - good: mostly reliable six month release schedule
    mint:
        install: 9/10
            - good: easy to use gui
            - good: quick install

            - neutral: there is no install option on boot. it goes to livecd
                       then an installer in launched optionally. could confuse
