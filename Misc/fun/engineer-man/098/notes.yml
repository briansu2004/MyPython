file/directory listing information:
    - special designator = - for file, d for directory
    - permissions = rwx for owner, rwx for group, rwx for others
    - owner = the name of the user that owns the file/directory
    - group = the name of the group that has permissions
      on the file/directory

file permissions:
    - r = read = able to view the contents of a file
    - w = write = able to modify the contents of a file
    - x = execute = able to run the file as an executable

directory permissions:
    - r = read = able to list the files within the directory
    - w = write = able to add/delete files to/from the directory
    - x = execute = able to cd into the directory and access files

setting permission examples:
    - `chmod 755 file.txt` (results in rwxr-xr-x)
    - `chmod 666 file.txt` (results in rw-rw-rw-)
    - `chmod 700 file.txt` (results in rwx------)
    - `chmod 000 file.txt` (results in ---------)
    - `chmod 777 file.txt` (results in rwxrwxrwx)
    - `chmod u+r file.txt` (adds read to owner)
    - `chmod g-r file.txt` (removes read from group)
    - `chmod o+r file.txt` (adds read to others)
    - `chmod a-w file.txt` (removes write from everyone)

special rules:
    - root has access regardless

attributes:
    - a = makes a file append only (only root can do this)
    - i = makes a file immutable (only root can do this)
    - s = deleting files also zeroes the blocks they were stored on
    - chattr [+/-][what to set] file.txt
    - chattr +i file.txt
