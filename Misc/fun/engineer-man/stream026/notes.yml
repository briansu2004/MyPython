talking points:
    relevancy:
        android:
            - alive and well
            - ~76% market share globally
            - essential to target everywhere
        ios:
            - alive and well
            - ~23% market share globally
            - essential to target in countries not sensitive to price
        everything else:
            - dead
            - ~1% market share
            - might not be worth targetting
        important notes:
            - android/ios is closer to 50/50 in america
    fragmentation:
        ios:
            - single vendor, apple
            - single design scheme
            - large percentage run latest ios days after release
              which is due largely to distribution from a single source
        android:
            - several vendors, google, lg, samsung, etc.
            - each vendor has their own version of "android"
            - phones may never get updates, updates may arrive late,
              updates may not even be the latest version
    development:
        plain old native:
            android:
                - android studio
                - java or kotlin
                - xml style ui definitions
                - maximum performance
            ios:
                - xcode
                - previously objective c
                - currently swift
                - visual builder
                - maximum performance
        cross platform native:
            react native:
                - uses web technologies
                - uses commonly known react
                - still produces real native app
                - builds to both android and ios
                pitfalls:
                    - doesn't implement 100% of everything from both platforms
                    - apps may not look identical between platforms
            flutter:
                - newer, but promising
                - uses lesser known language called dart
                pitfalls:
                    - doesn't implement 100% of everything from both platforms
                    - apps may not look identical between platforms
        game:
            overall notes:
                - games don't use native ui elements so cross platform is
                  much easier
            unity:
                - popular, free under a certain revenue ceiling
                - variety of platform support including android/ios
            unreal:
                - free under $3k then 5% royalty
                - variety of platform support including android/ios
        html5:
            pros:
                - cross platform
                - uses web technologies (ease of dev)
            cons:
                - uses web technologies (subpar performance relative
                  to native)
                - depending on os version, may not support multithreading
