Important Points:
- The Event Loop is single-threaded
- The Event Loop lets Node.js achieve concurrency; not parallelism,
  however, things that happen outside of your program do
  occur in parallel

Types of programs:
- Synchronous (single-threaded)
- Asynchronous (single-threaded w/ concurrency) <- Node.js is this
- Parallel (multi-threaded)
