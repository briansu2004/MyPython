talking points:
    vendors:
        top tier:
            - full suite of services
            - high pricing
            - ex. google gcp, amazon aws, ms azure, ibm, etc.
        mid tier:
            - most essential services
            - competitive pricing
            - ex. digital ocean, linode, dotblock, etc.
        low tier:
            - virtual machines only
            - cheap pricing
            - dreamhost, bluehost, godaddy, hostgator, etc.
    hosting types:
        fully dedicated server:
            - physical hardware deployed for one client
            - everything is built to spec and priced accordingly
            - highest cost
            - 100% of ram usable
            - 100% of cpus usable
        virtual private server:
            - physical hardware is divided up and virtualized
            - resulting virtual machine fully owned by one person
            - pay only for what you need
            - competitive cost
        shared server:
            - physical hardware deployed and shared
            - servers could house potentially 100's of clients
            - resources not guaranteed
    essentials:
        virtual machines:
            - mostly linux, sometimes windows
            - windows not likely to be available at low/mid tier hosts
            - usually newest images for leading distributions
            - ubuntu server, debian, and centos all but guaranteed to be present
            - some hosts offer a bring-your-own-image functionality
            - resizing generally occurs on demand
        block storage:
            - expandable storage that can be attached to machines
            - sometimes option exists to mount read only to multiple
            - usually appears as if it were a separate drive
        ip addressing:
            - auto assigned ips at creation
            - optional floating/static ips on demand
        bandwidth:
            - sometimes bandwidth is included with a virtual machine
            - sometimes bandwidth is billed per gb outbound
        scalable object storage:
            - infinitely scalable (as far as you're concerned)
        dns:
            - responsible for resolving domain names to ips
            - can either be where a domain name is registered or managed by a host
        firewalls:
            - might have an option to manage with host
            - otherwise, must be managed with iptables/firewalld/etc
