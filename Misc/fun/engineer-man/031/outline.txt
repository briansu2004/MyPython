Show & Tell Ep. 1 -- Blackjack Simulator

Level: Intermediate-Advanced

Why?
A friend of mine once suggested that the best strategy
for Blackjack is to never bust. Basically he suggested
that the player should hit only until he reaches 12 and
then stand. The player should also treat an Ace as an
11 in all cases. In this way, the bet is purely on the
dealer busting.
