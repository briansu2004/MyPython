tips:
    understand what it means to use or eject from expo:
        - only really one reason to eject -- native modules
        - slightly more complicated live reload
        - no more managed builds
        - less seamless upgrades
    understand that there is no dom:
        - referring to e.target is not a thing
        - dom manipulation is not a thing
        - however, there's some overlap
    use redux:
        - your app is one large root component
        - global state is quite helpful in some cases
        - things like toasts, dialogs, etc feel more natural procedurally
    consider using a ui framework:
        - this is based on preference, but really speeds everything up
        - i like material design, therefore i use react-native-paper
        - helps in android/ios specific issues
    it's ok to use a bunch of community modules:
        - react native core sometimes defers to community solutions
        - whatever you're used to in node.js/browser you can use here
