blockchain itself:
    types:
        centralized:
            - less common
            - good option when chain/network control is necessary
            - chain controlled by one organization
            - can suffer from trust issues
            - sometimes necessary if regulatory frameworks exist
        decentralized:
            - most common
            - no central ownership/control
            - network must agree on everything (protocol, algorithm, etc.)
            - chain exists on an unlimited number of nodes
    forks (decentralized only):
        soft:
            - unanimous consent/non-political changes
            - routine, usually for security matters
            - occurs at pre-defined block height
            - only one chain exists after fork
        hard:
            - non-consensual changes
            - results typically from disagreement over technology direction
            - two chains exist after fork
    operational components:
        blockchain:
            - immutable ledger of blocks
            - each block contains a bunch of transactions (count varies)
            - "transaction" is a generic term referring to money, apps, whatever
            - each block contains info about the previous block (except genesis block)
            - each block only valid after proof of work occurs (immutability)
        nodes:
            - downloadable software, written in various languages
            - communicates with other nodes on the network
            - maintains a full copy of the blockchain
            - receives new blocks and validates that pow has been done
            - transmits new blocks after mining/pow
        wallet (crypto only):
            - consists of a private key
            - unlimited addresses generated from this private key
            - inputs and outputs determine balance
            - can publish transactions into a network
        miners (which are also nodes):
            - responsible for confirming transactions
            - performing computationally intensive "work"
            - this work generally consists of hashing a block's header + nonce
            - rewarded with newly minted coins and tx fees
            - determines which chain is valid at a hard fork
ethereum:
    open platform:
        - allows developers to build things on top of ethereum
    currency utility:
        - has the same currency utility as, say, bitcoin
        - treats this functionality as one "app"
    distributed apps (dapps):
        - generic platform for various applications
        - uses custom programming language (solidity)
        - code, or contracts, are published into the blockchain network
        - each node operates an ethereum virtual machine for execution
        - apps can access/interact with other apps
        - many apps are underpinned by the ethereum currency
