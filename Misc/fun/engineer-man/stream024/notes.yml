problem solving:
    - think about the big picture
    - if the big picture is visual, do a sketch
    - break the problem into smaller problems
    - brainstorm solutions to those smaller problems
    - experiment
    - solve
    - combine smaller solutions together for a big solution
    - refine overall solution
