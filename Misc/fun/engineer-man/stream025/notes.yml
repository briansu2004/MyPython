http servers:
    apache:
        - free and open source
        - most popular, but is losing ground to nginx
        - xml style syntax
        - vast majority of php sites use apache due to mod_php
        - extensible through apache modules (dynamically loaded)
        modes:
            - prefork - one child process per request
            - worker - one child process per worker, one child thread per request
            - event - same as worker but better efficiency at long-lived conns
    nginx:
        - free and open source*
        - *has a paid commercial version with additional features
        - 2nd most popular, gaining ground on apache
        - simpler syntax resembling a basic programming language
        - has reasonable support for load balancing*
        - extensible through nginx modules (dynamically loaded)
        mode of operation:
            - starts configurable number of worker processes (or auto)
            - new thread with low memory footprint per request
    lighttpd:
        - free and open source
        - not very popular, but represents a good option if not apache/nginx
        - custom syntax which is simpler than apache but not as simple as nginx
    iis:
        - backed by microsoft
        - tightly integrated into microsoft workflows
        - uses iis manager (does not involve cli, people may like this)
        - common for .net and classic asp sites
        - can be used for static sites
        - can be used for non-microsoft stuff, php for example
    arguments:
        - apache vs nginx
