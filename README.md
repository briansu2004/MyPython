## My Python projects

REST APIs, Cloud, Kubernetes, NLP, Data Science, Machine Learning, AI etc.

...

- Created Full Stack REST APIs (backend) and VUE (front-end) apps to manage Dask Kubernetes Clusters and deployed to Azure

  - Coded the functions to manage Dask Kubernetes Clusters with Go and Python.
  - Monitored the Clusters with Kubectl and dashboard.
  - Programmed REST APIs with Go.
  - Built the UI with VUE and Vuetify.
  - Containerized the backend API app and UI app with Docker, managed with Azure ACR repository, deployed to Azure AKS and then exposed the API to a public IP.

- Worked as a Senior Cloud Platform Engineer to deliver multiple projects with Python, Java, Google Cloud, GitLab, Terraform, Bitbucket, Collibra, Menta, Airflow,

  - Designed and created different types of data-driven apps in GCP Google Cloud, including NodeJS apps, Python apps, Java apps, Data Flow pipelines, Cloud Services, Pub/Sub messaging apps etc.
  - Programmed Terraform to provision resources, manage role based access control (RBAC), and build multiple cloud deployment pipelines.
  - Designed and implemented the GitLab CI/CD pipelines with Python and Shell scripts to ingest and load lots of reference data to BigQuery for different environments and archived in GCS buckets.

- Created a Full Stack web app with Java and Angular for a large telecommunication client

  - Designed, created and updated the Swagger file for the REST APIs.
  - Implement the API endpoints with Python FastAPI framework (uvicorn ASGI, pydantic, pytest, SQLAlchemy, pymongo etc.)
  - Managed the Python libraries and packages with pip and requirement file.
  - Created the test cases and automated the unit tests and integration tests.
  - Containerize REST APIs with Docker and uploaded to the artifact repository.
  - Deployed to OpenShift and GCP with Jenkins pipeline.
  - Created front-end app with React, Material UI, and Bootstrap.

- Built a knowledge-based ontology graph database application for a federal client

  - Converted relational data model to Graph data model and imported to Neo4j.
  - Used Python NLP libraries and Azure Cognitive Services APIs to analyse data, extracted entities, key phrases, and categories, then do sentiment analysis with data science algorithms in Jupyter Notebook.
  - Visualized the ontology knowledge graphs with Neo4j Bloom and search phrases.

- Created a Python data science POC for a large supermarket chain client

  - Scraped neighborhood data from Wiki, acquired latitudes and longitudes data from the Geocoder, and retrieved location & venues data with Foursquare Places API.
  - Used k-means clustering to categorize and provided the recommendations.

- Built a Python AI POC for a government client to predict how much percent the issued parking tickets can be paid
  - Collected the data from various sources
  - Filtered out the outliers
  - Split for training and testing
  - Used a few algorithms and chose the best model which has the best Area Under the ROC Curve.
